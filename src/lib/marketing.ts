/**
 * Marketing arithmetic. Pure — no React, no Supabase — so it is directly
 * testable, like `lib/clients.ts`, `lib/shipping.ts` and `lib/costing.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️⚠️ THE TWO RULES THIS FILE ENFORCES:
 *
 * 1. **`campaigns.budget_minor` IS THE PLAN; `transactions` IS THE MONEY.**
 *    Never add a budget to a spend to report "what marketing cost" — that
 *    reports roughly double, the same family of bug as summing
 *    `maintenance_logs.cost_minor` (Phase 4), `orders.total_minor` (Phase 5)
 *    and ranking clients by agreed prices (Phase 6). A campaign planned at
 *    ₺5.000 that never ran spent ₺0.
 *
 * 2. **A SAMPLE IS COSTED, NEVER EXPENSED.** Nothing here produces a
 *    transaction. The filament was expensed when it was bought; charging again
 *    when the print is given away counts the same lira twice. What a sample is
 *    WORTH is computed at read time from the product, exactly as Phase 3
 *    computes product cost — and it goes stale the moment it is stored, which
 *    is why it never is.
